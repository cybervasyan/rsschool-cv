    <h3>Briefly About Myself</h3>
    <p>I graduated from Polytechnic University with a bachelor degree in economics.
        At the moment I am working as an accountant.
        A year ago I wanted to change my field of work, because I love IT.
        At first I learned Python, then I realized that front-end is more interesting for me.
        Now I am learning JavaScript and my dream is to become a front-end developer.</p>
