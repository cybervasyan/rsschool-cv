### Briefly About Myself:

I graduated from Polytechnic University with a bachelor degree in economics.
At the moment I am working as an accountant.
A year ago I wanted to change my field of work, because I love IT.
At first I learned Python, then I realized that front-end is more interesting for me.
Now I am learning JavaScript and my dream is to become a front-end developer.
